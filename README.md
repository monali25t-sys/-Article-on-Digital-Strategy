# Digital Strategy:
## Merging the real and virtual world
The era of digitalization is rewriting the way of approaching the market and, as a consequence, the strategies of competition. Today’s leaders need to take decisions in order to tackle and thrive under the new circumstances conceived by the digital revolution. The
merger of the real and the virtual world, together with business intelligence and technology, have impacted how business is done. Hence,
companies need to define their digital strategy. If not, they will be left behind. 

**Digital Strategy** is the application of digital technologies to business models to form new differentiating business capabilities. In the future, all business strategy will be digital strategy.

# Evolving the Definition of Business Strategy
Digital strategy focuses on using technology to improve business performance, whether that means creating new products or reimagining current processes. It specifies the direction an organization will take to create new competitive advantages with technology, as well as the tactics it will use to achieve these changes. This usually includes changes to business models, as new technology makes it possible for innovative companies to provide services that weren’t previously possible.

Today, technology has integrated with business to become something more than hardware or software. As digital technology becomes more pervasive and companies move further in the journey of digital transformation, digital strategy and business strategy will be the same thing. For now, it is still useful to use the term “digital strategy” to focus the effort behind digital initiatives.

It’s important to remember that digital strategy is both a concept and a thing — that is, a digital strategy should eventually lead to the creation of a concrete plan or roadmap. While you can keep changing the specific tactics you’ve decided to pursue, there should also be a clear commitment to your understanding of what digital means for your company.

As an example, say your digital strategy (ultimate goal) is to monetize basic productivity software that your business has already developed and uses internally. At first, you lay out a strategy (plan) to package it as a mobile app and sell it to individual users. Later, you realize that it has more value if you sell it to businesses to incorporate into their own mobile apps. Your strategy (ultimate goal) didn’t change, but your strategy (plan) did. Changing the guiding idea of your digital strategy should amount to a big shift or reorientation for your company, but ideally, the concrete steps will be flexible enough to allow you to pivot as needed.

# Digital Strategy in the Context of Digital Transformation
There is a tendency to talk about digital transformation interchangeably with digital strategy. The two terms are closely related, but differ in scope. Digital transformation drives change in three areas: customer experience, operational processes and business models. The process of digital transformation requires coordination across the entire organization, and involves business culture changes.

Digital strategy, on the other hand, focuses on technology, not culture. Digital strategy is most relevant to changes in business models, and uses technology to create the capabilities a company needs to become a digital business. Setting down a strategy is a key component of the transformation process, and ensures that technology is being implemented in a way that supports the business objectives.

# Digital Strategy vs. IT Strategy
Digital strategy looks for ways to use technology to transform activity, and therefore business, whereas IT strategy aims to transform technology in isolation from the rest of the business. Traditionally, the process of IT strategy has been to determine which technologies to invest in, based on the current direction of the business. Digital strategy instead looks at the activities and processes that need to be transformed to provide better services for customers. Then, it looks for the right combination of technologies and strategies that can be combined to create these experiences. Digital leaders have found new competitive advantages and opportunities for growth by making this shift in strategy.

# Where to Start
How do you build a digital strategy? Rather than asking, “What’s our digital strategy?”, an article from Harvard Business Review suggests using the five following questions to ground your understanding of digital technology:

1. Does digital technology change the businesses you should be in?
2. How could digital technology improve the way you add value to the businesses you are in?
3. Could digital technology change your target customer?
4. Does digital technology affect the value proposition to your target customer?
5. How can digital technology enhance the enterprise capabilities that differentiate you from your competition?
To some companies, these questions will have obvious answers, especially those that have already experienced disruption or competition from new digital players. The intention is to identify how digital changes what you do, and then refine your understanding from broad industry trends to specific values that will form the foundation of your strategy. By beginning with a clear understanding of your company’s purpose, you can avoid wasting time and resources implementing technology that doesn’t enable new competitive advantages.

# Common Elements of Digital Strategy
## Choose a Leader — 
This is arguably the most important part of creating a digital strategy, but choosing the right person will depend on company culture, structure and priorities. Whether companies place leadership with the CEO or an appointed Chief Digital Officer, the leader’s influence will need to match the scope of digital strategy; otherwise, it will be difficult to create the full buy-in from each department necessary to make effective changes.
## Attack vs. Defend —
McKinsey & Company emphasizes that companies would do well to categorize their potential threats and opportunities in digital business, then compare these against their own purpose. This clarifies whether a proactive or defensive stance needs to guide new initiatives.
## Take a Measured Approach —
Digital strategy often incorporates a process for assessing whether new technology will really complement or grow the current business. If you fear that your company is already behind on digital, it can be tempting to rush into a project without looking at how it fits your current strategy. By taking a measured approach, you can avoid wasting resources on initiatives that don’t align with your business’s needs and priorities.
## Future Proof — 
The goal of digital transformation is to create an appropriate foundation for digital business. This means creating an organization that can continue to reinvent itself as necessary to keep up with changes in technology and customer expectations. Digital strategy should be visionary enough to carry companies through changes in the digital economy, in a way that continues to bring a digital edge to the business.

Are you ready for what's next in healthcare?

# Digital Is No Longer A Differentiator
It has become part of everything we do as people and as businesses. However, its impact on the expectations of individual people is changing.People are increasingly expecting healthcare on their own terms, and they expect digital to be the enabler. From using data to understand meal preferences of a patient in hospital, and delivering those meals exactly when they want them, to delivering information through the right channel based on selected preferences—digital can support delivery of healthcare when, where and how
people want it.

Healthcare is in a unique place in the “post-digital” world. The industry has recognized that digital must become part of everything it does. And while investments in social, mobile, analytics and cloud (SMAC) technologies are progressing and demonstrating value, leaders must look ,toward what’s next to differentiate in this new era. There is no longer a separation of digital and non-digital. The future will be about full adoption of SMAC and embracing new technologies to transform outcomes and ultimately change lives. Planning today for the post-digital world is critical as healthcare enterprises continue on their digital transformation journeys.
This year’s Accenture Digital Health Tech Vision highlights five emerging trends that will shape healthcare enterprises over the next three to five years: DARQ Power, Get to Know Me, Human Worker, Secure US to Secure ME and MyMarkets. In each trend, you will see how the maturity of digital technologies across business and society is raising expectations, abilities and risk in healthcare. Fortunately, it’s an era of equally tremendous possibility.

# The Big Picture
Accenture’s Digital Health Tech Vision comprises a three-year set of technology trends, which includes our reports from 2018 and 2017. It’s important to recognize that this year’s trends are part of a bigger picture. As healthcare companies continue to grow as digital
businesses, they will need to keep up with the latest technologies, as well as continue to master those that have been maturing. These technologies will collectively inform how enterprises build the next generation of business and create paths toward future growth.

# Trend 1
## DARQ POWER-
### Understanding the DNA of DARQ

New technologies are catalysts for change, offering
extraordinary new capabilities when applied appropriately. 

The next set of emerging technologies—Distributed ledger technology (DLT), artificial intelligence (AI), extended reality (XR) and quantum computing—can spark a step change that allows businesses to reimagine entire industries.Years ago, social, mobile, analytics and cloud (SMAC) technologies emerged, allowing businesses to understand their partners and consumers at unprecedented depth. Healthcare
enterprises are adopting SMAC as part of their digital transformations, but they have not come as far in adoption maturity as other industries. The adoption of SMAC in healthcare also varies by industry sector. Payers have embraced SMAC to a greater degree than providers over the past decade. A majority of providers are just beginning the journey as they are in early stages of their
digital transformations. 

The imperative has become stronger for healthcare organizations to adopt technologies that create a digital foundation for the future. Accenture’s Disruptability Index, which analyzes disruption across 20 industries, puts healthcare among the most vulnerable to future disruption.
1 .Those most vulnerable to disruption are under pressure to scale new technologies. Some are mastering the new as part of their core business while others are experimenting to learn how these technologies can deliver new sources of value. The most successful healthcare organizations will be those that recognize change is in motion.
2. While driving the use of SMAC technologies to maturity in their application to healthcare, they will be thinking about—and
planning for—the future impact of DARQ technology on their enterprises. 

# Seeing Into The DARQ

## DARQ technologies and some of the capabilities they enable

DARQ technologies are poised to become the foundation for next-generation products and services. Healthcare leaders in the DARQ-driven future will be prepared to combine and exploit those competencies as the technologies reach enterprise-level maturity. 

Even before DARQ technologies have reached full maturity, healthcare enterprises can see the value on the horizon. Whether lowering the cost of care, improving labor productivity or enabling better experiences for consumers and partners, regardless of training or intent, DARQ potential runs deep. To take advantage of the transformational new capabilities that DARQ technologies will offer, payers and providers must explore the possibilities now

# DLT
In the future, distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain, will be an important part of healthcare payments and identity
management. Healthcare enterprises can reduce waste, save costs and increase quality of care by using DLT to create a trusted set of
data so that people can act on the information rather than having to go back to the source of truth to verify its authenticity. DLT shows great promise for qualifying individuals for insurance benefits, identifying patient payment obligations and credentialing providers, rather than clinicians having to go through a similar process across multiple care settings. The Professional Credentials Exchange (ProCredEx) is a distributed ledger program that cuts—for providersand organizations vetting providers—the time, cost and complexity associated with the credentialing process.3 The Synaptic Health Alliance intends to use DLT to create a cooperatively owned provider data exchange to collect and share changes to provider data, starting with demographics. 

# AI
When asked to rank which of the DARQ technologies will have the greatest impact on their organization over the next three years, 41%
of healthcare executives ranked AI number one. AI has perhaps the greatest number of emerging use cases in healthcare. The
constellation of artificial intelligence technologies is already having tremendous impact on labor, a substantial line item in healthcare. AI is used in contact centers, for payment activities, medical chart reviews and it can help patients take part in self-service.Healthcare organizations are using the full collection of AI technologies to change how we interact with doctors. AI will augment diagnoses—it can already identify diseases based on facial features,4 retina scans, X-rays and speech—and it can even help patients to self-diagnose before they walk through the doors of the doctor’s office. Froedtert Health and the Medical College of Wisconsin Health Network partnered with Buoy to deliver an interactive digital tool that allows users to enter their symptoms and receive—in real time— personalized analysis and recommendations for care options. Buoy uses an algorithm to listen and calculate input, and it gets smarter as more people use the too

# XR
Interestingly, extended reality shows the highest adoption of DARQ technologies with 38% of healthcare organizations having adopted
XR across one or more business units. XR allows machines to operate cognitively, as humans do, and it allows people to interact naturally with technology. The technology makes immersive experiences commonplace and it solves for time and distance, making each
factor less relevant.Cedars-Sinai is using XR for pain management. By using XR to teach patients how to better cope with pain through breathing techniques and positive thinking, they were able to reduce pain by 24% after 10 minutes.6 Cleveland Clinic and Zygote Medical Education are using virtual reality to move clinical anatomy curriculum out of the cadaver lab and into a virtual environment. Students can use their mobile devices to access precise 3D models of anatomy and connect with peers all over the world.

# QUANTUM
Healthcare organizations will be making quantum leaps in the future, using the technology to crunch complex data sets, such as DNA
data, to enable more personalized medicine and interactions. For instance, quantum tech gurus at Accenture and 1QBit collaborated
with biotechnology innovator Biogen to develop a first-of-its-kind quantum-enabled molecular comparison application that could
significantly improve advanced molecular design to speed up drug discovery for complex neurological conditions such as multiple
sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Lou Gehrig’s Disease.

# Trend 2
## Get To Know Me
### ## Unlock unique consumers and unique opportunities

The sets of technologies people use are now so integrated
into their lives that they have become a part of their identities. 

Data captured in the digital and physical worlds, along with related data sets (e.g. demographics,
sociographics), can converge to create a technology identity for an individual. Healthcare leaders
can use people’s technology identities to create a new generation of offerings and experiences.
The digital revolution introduced technology identities as part of an emerging feedback loop, one
that first began to show potential via personalization efforts. Thanks to ecosystem connections,
healthcare organizations are increasingly using these identities to deliver more personalized and
individualized services. For instance, Kinsa’s connected thermometers let customers track their
fevers via a smartphone app; Clorox paid to license the information, using it to direct ads to US
ZIP codes where people had more fevers (and potentially more need for disinfecting wipes). No
personally identifying information was ever shared.10 Now, in the post-digital era, organizations
have greater opportunity to use technology identities and insights to shift from one-off
transactions to ongoing customized relationships with individualized experiences. 

# Trend 3
## Human + Worker
### Change the workplace or hinder the workforce

Digital transformations arent just about technology
—theyre about people. 

Businesses across the healthcare industry are witnessing the rise of a human + machine
collaborative workforce where each individual is empowered by their skillsets and knowledge
plus a new, constantly growing set of capabilities made possible through technology.
Today’s healthcare workers are incorporating technology to perform their current roles in new
ways and to adapt for new roles that did not exist in the pre-digital era. However, the workforce
is evolving so rapidly with the help of technology, the enterprise supporting the workforce has
yet to catch up.
As healthcare organizations continue to innovate and push boundaries, they will need to
create new jobs and new roles immersed in technology. They will need to invest in new ways to
train and reskill employees for the post-digital age. They will also need to capture institutional
knowledge so that it remains in house, rather than in the minds of people who may be
transitioning in and out of jobs.

# Trend 4
## Secure Us To Secure Me
### Enterprises are not victims, they are vectors

The need for collaboration is as great in healthcare
as in any other industry. 

Healthcare organizations enjoy the benefits of collaborating with the ecosystem—providers,
payers, device companies, equipment manufacturers and more—but those connections increase
risk. Through collaboration, businesses are extending, and absorbing, the risk and vulnerabilities
of their ecosystem partners. Yet most businesses still look at cybersecurity as strictly an
individual effort.
It’s an especially tough spot for healthcare organizations because unlike in other industries,
they sometimes don’t have a choice about with whom they collaborate. It’s a mandate.
This heightened level of exposure is good news for the “bad guys” who view ecosystems as an
ever-widening attack surface. Healthcare businesses must, in response, evolve their approach
and stand up a stronger security posture that factors in ecosystem partners. New models and
policies must ensure that the partners and third parties joining the ecosystem adhere to the
same standard of security—or higher—that they set for themselves.
The need for collaboration is as great in healthcare
as in any other industry.


# Trend 5
## Mymarkets
### Meet consumers needs at the speed of now

Healthcare is more connected than ever in the post-digital age. 

Digital expectations have now evolved and a new opportunity to deliver better experiences
is on the table: capturing moments. Technology has created a world of intensely customized
and on-demand experiences, so healthcare organizations must reinvent themselves to find
and capture those opportunities as they come.
Powerful analytics capabilities allow payers and providers to understand their current and
potential markets and identify moments that matter. Sophisticated backend technology can
reorient the business quickly and help it pull together the right capabilities and services at the
right time to deliver a remarkable experience at a specific point in time. Miss the moment, miss
the chance.
Many are investing in the tools it will take, such as AI to predict trends and preferences,
and forecasting to identify and act on future opportunities in the moment. Is your business
equipped to unlock these momentary markets?
